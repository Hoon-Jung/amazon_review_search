It still closed completely but the plastic made to look like leather was literally falling off, so it was time for a new one. Cigarette cases for kings size cigs are not easy to come by these days I discovered, but I was thrilled to find this one on Amazon. It was a great price, REAL LEATHER, and even had the cool zipper pouch on the back. I was so excited to get my case and toss that other one! Well, within THREE DAYS one of the gold clasps literally broke off! I couldn't believe it! I tried to super glue it back on and was not successful. so, I still use the case but it doesn't close securely. I was very disappointed that my $3.00 plastic one lasted 7 years and this real nice leather one lasted 3 days!! But I still love the zipper pouch on the back, it's great for the spare key to my car because I will not go ANYWHERE without my cigarettes!", "summary": "Top Clasp Broke Within 3 days!", "unixReviewTime": 1365811200}
